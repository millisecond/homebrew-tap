  # No auto-launch postflight: Homebrew 6 runs install steps inside a sandbox
  # that can't reach RunningBoard, so `open` fails there (kLSUnknownErr,
  # "Couldn't communicate with a helper application") and takes the whole
  # install down with it. The README's install command (also the in-app
  # upgrade command) ends with `open -a` instead.

  # Stop the running app on uninstall and upgrade — otherwise it keeps
  # running from the deleted bundle and holds the single-instance lock.
  # on_upgrade: brew skips `signal` during upgrade/reinstall without it.
  # Array form on purpose: brew replays the OLD cask from the JSON it saved
  # at install, which turns a bare :signal into "signal", and it ignores a
  # String there. An array survives (Homebrew 6).
